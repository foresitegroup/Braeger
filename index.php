  <span style="font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.1em;">If you have been redirected here via AutomotiveFund.com, please note that the Internet Investment Portal that we marketed through has been discontinued. We have decided to take a more direct, personalized approach to building a relationship with our investors, and have abandoned the crowdfunding approach. The investment options are the same. Only the process has changed.</span>
</div>

The Braeger Auto Finance Group is driven to deliver superior returns to our qualified finance partners.  We believe the best way to enhance investment returns is through a value-added operating strategy with acceptable levels of measured risk. Whether you are an existing independent auto dealer or a prospective accredited investor, we are always grateful to take part in these mutually beneficial relationships.<br>
<br>

We exist to serve you.  Our mission is to help the dealer maximize profitability while allowing our accredited investment partners to benefit from our dealer relationships.  With over 50 years of combined banking and financial services experience, we are confident we can do the job for you.<br>
