<h2>WHY PARTICIPATE IN AUTO LOAN FINANCING?</h2>
Auto finance has re-emerged as one of the fastest growing sectors of the financial markets.  Because automobiles are a necessity in the lives of most Americans, it makes sense that the outlook has improved in this business faster than in other areas of the credit spectrum, such as mortgages.  Braeger Auto Finance Group is positioned to help qualified finance partners benefit from this trend.  We can provide attractive annual returns while still aggressively protecting your capital.<br>
<br>

The main reason for the broad based recovery in this sector comes from the very nature of the asset.  It is simple.  People need cars for all aspects of their daily lives.  Whether it is getting to work, shopping for groceries, getting the kids to their activities, or travel for work or pleasure, people have become exceedingly reliant on their car.  Therefore, unlike the housing market where renting is an option, or credit cards where default is an option, people will put priority to their automobile because there is no viable option.<br>
<br>

Because of the necessity of cars in our daily lives, even people with damaged credit will do all they can to make their car payments and make sure they do not default.  A default results in the loss of the car, which can lead to the loss of the job that the car facilitates.<br>
<br>

Because of the re-emergence of the credit market for automobiles, there are fantastic opportunities for our accredited investors to take part in the returns.  Braeger Auto Finance Group has a tailored note approach for our accredited investment partners. This allows them to put their capital preservation at a higher premium than ever before, while putting the dealer in a situation that they can extend their lines of credit and take on additional loans to leverage and grow.<br>
<br>
