  David Braeger, CEO of Braeger Finance, has been in the financial business for over 23 years working for firms such as Paine Webber, Bear Stearns, Mesirow Financial, and Newport Coast Securities. David has specialized in the funding of alternative investments for numerous companies and sectors.<br>
  <br>

  David created Braeger Finance to help long-standing independent automobile dealers enhance the value of their company and credit lines, giving them the ability to enhance the value of dealer franchises while helping them maintain and grow their loan portfolio as opposed to have note buyers profit from the purchase of their notes.<br>
  <br>

  David grew up in the auto dealership world. His grandfather formed the first Braeger automotive dealership in 1923, and his father built on that success after World War II.  While Braeger Finance LLC is unrelated to the Braeger auto dealerships, David has deep and broad knowledge of the auto dealership industry, and has helped with financing with auto dealerships for the last four years.<br>
  <br>

  David received his B.A. in Liberal Arts from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX and received his M.B.A. from The Lake Forest Graduate School of Management in Lake Forest, IL.  David has served on numerous boards including The Boys and Girls Clubs, The Y.M.C.A., and the Peace Learning Center of Milwaukee.  David is an active member of The Kiwanis Club of Milwaukee.
