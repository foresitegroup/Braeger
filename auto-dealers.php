<h2>SERVING INDEPENDENT USED CAR DEALERS</h2>
For many independent auto dealers, raising capital to finance inventory is an ongoing challenge.  Braeger Finance understands the unique challenges that they face.  We take the time to understand each dealer's situation and objectives to help them increase their credit lines as well as maximize their profitability.<br>
<br>

As many financial institutions have pulled their support from the independent automotive business, Braeger Finance is expanding our services in order to help dealers to expand their business.  We help dealers build their portfolio of renewable loan customer financing with our unique lending services.  Braeger Finance is open to financing in a wide range of terms and credit criteria, providing significant after-market profit opportunities.<br>
<br>

Braeger Finance is a true friend to the dealers, which is what separates us from traditional floorplan lenders.  By offering attractive loans to the dealers we can minimize the excessive fees that drive up the cost of what most independent dealers ultimately pay for their financing.<br>
<br>

We are a strategic lender who can help independent auto dealer finance companies increase their existing floor plan and credit facility.  By providing capital to qualified dealers, we assist them to increase the strength of their loan portfolio while allowing them to maintain and profit from their portfolios instead of selling tranches of loans to buyers that include national banks.  However, if needed, we do have the ability to help the dealer sell tranches of their portfolio after a Loan Portfolio Analysis is performed.  As an industry partner who is investing in their growth and success, we have created a business model that is designed and implemented to provide scalability to support their growth.<br>
<br>

Braeger Finance engages with accredited investors who have the dealer's best interests in mind, so they know they are working with a financial services company that is looking to work with them and help ensure their success.
