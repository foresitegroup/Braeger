<h2>INTRODUCTION TO AUTO DEALER FINANCE INVESTING</h2>
Most people try to generate income by following conventional wisdom and investing their investment assets in the equities market.  They let other people like fund managers control their money and make decisions for them in a very fragile marketplace- the stock market.  After years of investing many investors find that their portfolio has barely kept up with inflation or, even worse, their portfolios have gone backwards in value.  The best example of that was the financial crisis of 2007, which we have not fully come out of.  Worst of all for current retirees, bank rates are at frightening lows, endangering retirement plans.<br>
<br>

For this reason, Braeger Auto Finance Group LLC has created alternative, high yielding notes in hopes of turning investor portfolios around.  We offer our accredited investors high-yielding, passive investment vehicles backed by the support of high-performing, highly valued auto dealer finance portfolios and support and integrity of finance professionals with over 50 years of banking and financial services experience that are dedicated to keeping qualified finance partner's money secure.<br>
<br>

Private auto dealer renewable notes are not for everyone, and before any investor places money in our note program, it is imperative that he or she has a complete understanding of what the investment is, whether this type of investment is appropriate for him or her and whether the investor qualifies for all suitability requirements required to invest in the notes.
